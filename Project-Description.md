# Project Background Description

Our project is based on the investment finance sector. We use Tensorflow machine learning models to give make approximate prediction of stocks' opening prices the next day. The main interface will be a mobile app (Android so far) that users can download and provide their own stock predictions. The user will give two prediction: one with the ML model’s prediction input taken into account and another without. The next day, when real stock prices are available, user can compare the two predictions made yesterday with real values. The point of the app is to help beginners in stock investment practice their decision-making skills. It is often costly to make bad investment based on simple speculation without any machine’s input. We hope by using the app, users will be able to improve their weaknesses.

# Project Problem Statement

People who are beginners to invest stock need some trainings before they do the real investment. This app is to help people to get more familiar with the stock’s historical prices and predict with machine learning advice. Later on, the app will compare user’s prediction with machine learning and user’s prediction to see which is more precise.  

# Inadequacy of current solutions to problem

Current solutions are not easily accessible to people of all backgrounds. Most of the programs are highly developed and require expert knowledge of machine learning to understand. For example, when we searched for ML algorithms to make prediction on a data set, we get Medium blog posts or research papers that use technical terms. Therefore, we want to create a solution that is friendly to non-technical users and found a mobile app is the best approach. We aspire our software to be simple, effective, and easy to pick up for those who just want to deal with finance.

# Background skills/interests applicable to problem

Our group members have experience in mobile and web development. We have little experience in machine learning but we were all exposed to some basic concepts. Our advisor, professor Minai, is an expert in Machine Learning - Neural Network field, so we are looking forward to learning a lot from him. By doing this project, we hope to learn project development from start to finish, from front end (mobile app design), to back end (cloud storage systems).

# Your project team approach to problem, including the overall goals and your team expectations for final product/demo

We get historical data of opening and closing stock prices for the past couple of years on NYSE. We also use daily stock prices from some Finance APIs such as Google or Yahoo Finance. With the data, we will use machine learning to train Tensorflow models (RNNs, etc) to give rough prediction of stocks' opening prices the next day. So the user can predict the second day stock price with machine learning advice. Then we compare the the prediction made by user and made by user with machine learning to see if machine learning advice is useful.
