## Getting Started - App overview
Upon clicking the app icon, this is the home page of the app. New installation doesn't have any stock yet, so the intro screen prompts new user to add their first stock.

## Add a new stock in your porfolio
Each user has a portfolio of tracked stocks. You can start adding stocks by clicking the add button in lower righ corner.

The add button will let you input the ticker symbol of the stock. If the name doesn't exist, the app shows "UNKNOWN" as ticker symbol.

After you added your stocks, the app will start to get information about its open and close prices, company's name, storage for user's predictions, etc. Each stock will be displayed as a card in the home page.

## Viewing your portfolio
The home page shows the list of stocks you added so far. Each stock includes ticker symbol, company's name, current prices and denomination.

To add even more stocks, simply click on the plus button and provide the ticker symbol.

## Make trading decisions and getting predictions
Daily, you can click on stock ticker symbol to open up the menu to add your predicted price for that stock. Submit your insight by tapping the "submit" button. After that, you can view the Machine Learning model's prediction for that same stock. 

## Checking your progress
Once in a while, you can check your progress by tapping on an individual stock to open a new window. Scroll to the bottom to view charts, metrics and scores. The data is saved from some period of usage, the longer you use the app, the more accurate it becomes.
