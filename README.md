Senior Design class project (Fall 2018 and Spring 2019)

# Tentative Project Background Description

Our project is based on the investment finance sector. We use Tensorflow machine learning models to give make approximate prediction of stocks' opening prices the next day. The main interface will be a mobile app (Android so far) that users can download and provide their own stock predictions. The user will give two prediction: one with the ML model’s prediction input taken into account and another without. The next day, when real stock prices are available, user can compare the two predictions made yesterday with real values. The point of the app is to help beginners in stock investment practice their decision-making skills. It is often costly to make bad investment based on simple speculation without any machine’s input. We hope by using the app, users will be able to improve their weaknesses.
